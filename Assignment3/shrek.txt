Shrek Forever After
= SHREK Forever After =
Once upon a time,
a long time ago
a king, a queen and their
beautiful daughter named Fiona.
But she was possessed by a terrible curse.
By day a lovely princess,
by night a hideous ogre.
Only true love kiss can lift the curse
So Fiona waited in a tower
guarded by a dragon
until the day when
true love would arrive.
As the days turned into years
and the king and queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures
I do not know what to say, Lilian.
Fairy said that only love kiss
True Fiona can break the curse.
I do not trust that woman, Harold.
This could be our last hope.
And also, he was highly recommended by
King Leonidas.
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands.of this cursed ..
.. he is devious .. deceitful ..
misleading and is...
Rumpelstiltskin.
Your Highness ...
What's up?
Good?
As you can see
everything is in order.
And you finally put an end to our daughter's curse?
And you will sign the kingdom of
Far Far Away, over to me
- This is madness.
- What choices do we have, Harold?
Fiona had been locked awan in that tower
far too long
and she's not getting any younger.
But to give up the entire kingdom...
right, if the kingdom is worth
more than your daughter...
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.
Skip Fifi, jump!
All your problems will disappear.
Majesty, the princess .. she's been saved!.
Ahhh..
Who saved her?
None other than
an ogre named Shrek
whose howl
was known throughout the land.
would save the beautiful princess Fiona.
true loves kiss lead to
marriage and children
And the kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.
And they lived happily
ever after.
Sir, you will have to
pay for that.
Maybe we can make a deal, little boy?.
I am not a real boy.
You want to be one?
No more troubles, Rumpelstiltskin!.
I wish that ogre was
never born.
Wake up Daddy.
Wake up.
Good morning, darling.
Good morning to you
Better outside than inside.
This is my reply.
My little Fergus has make ..
The ogre stinks!.
Unenforceable.
OK, the Dragon passes under bridge
through the loops
and finally into the castle.
Then he kissed Shrek Princess
which has been turned into a beautiful
ogre and lived ..
- happily... everl...
- after!
Look, a shooting star.
What do you want?
that every day to be like this one.
Aww, come here.
One Love ..
One heart
to be together
Morning Daddy.
Morning.
Better outside than inside.
My little Fergus a...
Nice, very nice.
Shrek...
She turned into a
nice ogre
And they lived .. happily .. after
Good morning.
Better outside than inside.
Again our house!
Our house!
And lived ..... happily ... ever ... after
Nice landing, dear.
And remember:
not to eat donkey
Happy Birthday!
To start spending
Hey, Shrek. Shrek.
Sir Shrek, will you sign
forks and torches?
- You were so scary.
- Yes, when you were a real ogre.
When I was a real ogre ?
Happy Birthday!
Shrek .. sing along
sing along
No thanks.
Please, I will be your best friend.
Why assume that I do
everything that I want to do?
Please Felicia,
Not in Daddy's ears
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek.
Could you do that
ogreish roar for my son?
It's a big fan.
Do roar.
I rather not to.
It's my kids' birthday party.
Do roar.
Honey, why do not you go
check the cake.
- Sure
- And do not forget the candles.
Do not move.
More trousers
Man cake.
Sir Shrek .. voilla..
Your cake.
What is that supposed to be?
This is the Ogre !
Isn't it cute?
Cheer up!, Shrek is a pie.
Are in very good condition.
I gonna lick a mouthful
- Donkey.
- As long as you do something
How about that famous Shrek roar ?
Do roar.
Ogre only roars when he is angry, you do not want to see me angry.
Do you?
Do it!
I think I'd better go ..
Father, he is getting away ..
Do something.
OK
What happened with the cake?
Trust me, it is an improvement.
You licked.
Just because you're an ogre
does not mean you have to eat like one.
It seems that you forgot the candles.
Watch the cake
I'll go get the candles.
Watch the cake?
Where's the cake?
- the cake... ?
- What?
No, not crying.
Hey, I think you promised
my son a roar.
Do roar.
- I do not like.
- We need another cake.
But there is no other cake.
Shrek will make his famous roar.
Not now, Donkey.
Are there any cupcakes?
- I ate.
- There are lollipops.
I licked.
Shrek, what happens?
Do roar.
I love you, Daddy.
Everyone.
Another cake.
Shrek are you good?
- Unbelievable.
- Well, I mean?
- Those villagers...
- I am not talking about the villagers
I am talking about you.
Do you really want them to remember
this as their first birthday?
Oh great, so it is my fault?
Yes, but talk about it
later, at home.
You mean the roadside attraction
we live in?
Stop rights up
See the dancing Ogres..
Do not be afraid, he does not bite.
I was an ogre,
now I'm just a jolly green joke!
OK, maybe you are not the ogre you used to be
but maybe that's not a bad thing..
I do not expect you to understand
- you're not a real ogre.
You've spent half of your life
in a palace.
And the other half
locked in a tower.
All I want is for things
as they used to be
When villagers are afraid of me
and I could take a mudbath
in peace
I could do what I wanted.
Back when the world make sense.
You mean back before you rescue me from the dragon's keep?
Exactly!
Shrek we have three beautiful children,
a wife who loves you,
friends who adore you.
Of everything.
Why is it the only person that cannot see this ..
is you ?
--
Great, I am not going to apologize
that I acting like one.
help me.. I
help
Come on .. help
come .. anyone
Please, help me!
Someone, anyone!
Help me? Pain...
I see a bright light...
- Grandma?
- Yeah, me, grandma.
An ogre!
Please, sir ogre,
Please do not eat me!
I will not eat...
But you're an ogre, right?
Yes... but... I was.
Move out or get crushed.
- So you will not eat me?
- No, thanks.
I had already.big breakfast
- Wait, where are you going?
- Nowhere.
- What a coincidence! I was just there myself.
Seriously, I want to give you a ride
I insist. Come on.
That's the lease I can do. After all you done for me...
I got a hot bath cooking
Hi !
Welcome!
Liquid. to ease your frustrations
- What?
- Maybe just one.
Talk about it...
I envy you, Shrek. No responsibilities
The life of a Ogre ...
You are free to pillage, to terrorize ..
Free? That's a laugh
And?
Sometimes I wish I had one day to become a real ogre again
Oh, why didn't you say so?
Magical transactions are my specialty. Come on!
Magicians and mimes are my favorite people
Yes, wait a minute...
King for a month, a week...
Ogre for a day.
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated...
People would say: "Leave me alone!
Shrek I fear it's hard! "
will be just like good old days in your swamp,
with your castle.
When the world make sense.
Alright, what;s the catch?
Catch? No catch ..
haw haw .. Nothing, just something small, nothing...
Alright, I knew it ... So, what do you want?
- A day.
- A day ..
Ahh.. Rat's ready
For magic to work you
must offer something in to get something
In that case, be
to give one day to return. Both.
I can not just pick up and leave my family...
But this is the best, Shrek.
Magic is a contract!
They will not know that you are gone
- You gonna feel like a changed Ogre .
- Still, I do not know...
what day ..
Oh, I don't know, any day .. a day in your past
The day you had the flu, when
you lost a pet...
One day an Ogre put his nose in
wrong place
.. and destroy your life!
As an example what about day I met Donkey?
that's the day I'd like to take back .. ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
How about a day that you
do not remember?
like a day when you were a baby.
innocent.. mindless .. little baby
Take any ot those days you like
Take them all if you like
Ah, just one will do
OK good..
a day in your childhood.
I think there's nothing wrong if
I want some time for me.
Only 24 hours are lousy.
- Are the same Ogre !
- Yes! I never need to ask permission from anyone before
So why start now, huh?
--
Come on, Shrek! Sign!
Come on, Shrek!
Sign it! Sign it!
He's signed it ..
What happens next?
- Have a nice day. heh heh ..
I think I fell on the keys.
Awesome...
Across the river and forest...
Ogre!
It kills the ogre!
That's the part where you run!
It's great to be back
chased by police.
It's that good.
Fiona.
No!
My house...
Fiona!
Fiona! Are you there?
Ogre!
We worry about!
Get him!
Bravo, ladies!
Witch, you make a mistake!
- I know my rights!
- You have the right to shut up!
Donkey, do not sing!
Donkey!
Donkey, where are they?
What happens?
Quiet!
I hate this song!
I drive so I choose the music.
Once you decide you want?
Donkey, what happens?
You know where is Fiona?
Quiet, Ogar.
I do matters.
I need this place work.
Do not go back
at Old Macdonald.
No, it is exactly what I mean.
Where are my kids?
And where is your wife, Dragon?
Ogar, believe me confused
speaking with another donkey.
I have not seen in my life.
There you saw me?
Come on, Donkey.
How do you know my name?
I am, Shrek
your best friend?
A friend with a Ogre ass?
It's the dumbest
I have heard.
Can you tell me where I even go?
Where to go all Ogars.
On Rumpelstiltskin.
Stiltskin?
Quiet!
There...
It's time to bet?
Let us bet.
Gum?
Disgusting!
Filthy brute!
Sickening!
Move out
Do not worry, Donkey!
We'll recover your life.
Yeah, right.
You're crazy.
Mr. Stiltskin!
You have a customer.
- Lupu!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.
Bring me the wig business.
Mr. Stiltskin!
Please, please me
a real boy!
Read details.
Sayonara termites!
Stiltskin!
Shrek
Here it is.
I was so close.
Since you expect!
Ladies, this is the guy who
did everything possible.
Tell me how you like your day?
What's happening?
What have you done?
It's not what I have done,
it's what you have done.
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
sign the kingdom .. over to me.
It would not do that!
Yes, if I promised
that all their problems will disappear.
Then .. they disappeared.
No!
Would do anything to
lift the curse on their daughter.
I got up and curse!
What if you could not
you ever?
You better explain clearly
little bastard!
Do you draw!
You gave me one day in your past,
one of which does not remember.
A day that you were an innocent baby.
Got the day I was born.
No, Shrek.
You gave it to me!
Enjoy as mauch as you can, Stiltskin.
Because at the end of the day...
Did you hear the best part.
Why you were not born earlier,
so the end of the day you will end too.
Where is Fiona?
Where is my family?
Silly Ogre ...
You do not understand, right?
You you were not born.
You have not met Fiona,
your children were never there!
How about this metaphysical paradox?
It seems that you get exactly what you wanted.
A happy Ogre day!
Get him, witch!
You know what we have here?
Stop it!
Why stay, useless witch?
Be right back, Donkey!
I do not know!
Do not know.
Glad you do not.
Help!
No! Not the globe!
Lupu, mad wig!
Donkey, get out of my head!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Gotta calm down.
They are your friend.
Do not do any harm, right?
Good. A way to give you... now.
Please eat my face last.
Start with hooves.
Donkey must
You trust me.
Why should I trust you?
Because... because...
Welcome! Run!
Who needs you?
I have never seen
an ogre crying.
- Do not cry.
- You have nothing to be ashamed.
I cry all the time.
I think of grandma.
Or kittens.
And grandmother with kittens.
Kittens grandmother.
I said not complain.
Relax.
Just trying to help.
Not my business.
But why are you angry?
I was tricked into signing
something that I should not.
You took those actions, right?
No. I signed it.
You should not sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin.
Yes, I understand now.
- the small prints...
- I know.
- Exit clause is hidden.
- Yes...
What?
Exit clause.
But now everyone knows
Who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Donkey, I read the small prints and
says nothing of exit clause.
Do not expect it to be easy, right?
Let me show you how.
I spent long time in company of
witches not without learn anything.
Your little brain can not understand
My bending complexity of skills.
- What are you doing?
- I can not do origami site if I leave.
Thank you.
Look what you done.
A doubt... look like.
I'll show you how...
Here!
Try Lois Bliss.
Lois tries happiness.
Give me that!
True loves kiss.
Could say that first.
Under the contract, if you are not
satisfied, true love kiss
cancel this contract!
Donkey, you have succeeded!
Look at you.
If Fiona gives me a love kiss
I will restore my true life!
I do not pander!
Where is Fiona?
That's the problem...
I do not know.
I used to
I think what I did.
So where you left it last?
Last time I saw her I said
Because I do not want to be saved.
There...
Shrek
Wait, wait!
Are you crazy?
Dragon's there!
Okay, go!
I remain here to look
something for breakfast!
Fiona!
There...
If I saved myself Fiona...
Who did it?
That should give me Fiona
the day we met.
Is the symbol of our love.
Smell it!
Get that dirty thing away from me!
Only your nose can find my wife.
So do not cry and smells.
Smell it! Get it!
Do I look somewhat like a dog?
If you have not noticed
I am a donkey, not a dog.
If the dog was telling me
Donkey dog.
And one more thing...
Wait a minute.
Smell something.
- Something sweet.
- Fiona.
- Taste...
- Talk of my wife!
Donkey!
Waffles!
I thought it was just a story!
A sticky stack of wafers
golden delicious!
Donkey! Do not eat!
It's a stack of waffles
Fresh in the middle of the forest.
Did not seem at all suspicious?
You...
No, Donkey!
I said NO!
No! Get out there!
You did.
Warning!
- Donkey! Are you okay?
- Yes.
Donkey!
Help! Help me?
Shrek
Look, a new one!
Dressed in holiday vest.
- It's small, right?
- Yes.
We have brought a comrade and
why we're grateful.
- Put it out! Come on!
- Wait a minute!
Here!
Welcome to the Resistance.
Resistance?
Struggle for freedom and for
ogres around the world!
I knew we can do that.
Help!
I have meningitis.
And are poisonous.
I take it.
It is good to go.
I have not cleaned up yet.
Believe me, not you
eat it on that.
Easy but hard to get out!
Fiona!
How happy I am that I found you!
You may not have been in training, but in the future
be careful to respect personal space.
You do not know who they are, right?
No. Brogan, we've are in
Far Far Away Land.
Gather the others and meet me at 
the war room.
Fiona!
Make sure that all are prepared
to leave at night.
- I must speak with you.
- What?
Okay, I know you do not remember me,
but we are married.
Listen.
I was at the party with some pigs
and villagers and a boy
told me to rag
and I have to punch in cake
you ate pigs
and the donkey fell after the waffles into the hole!
No? Who supports me?
I think they hit him
stronger than expected.
Fiona, you must...
Witch!
Know what to do?
- Fiona!
- No, witch!
Fiona's third patrol today.
We can not hide forever.
After Tonight
nor will be, Brogan.
- Is that your wife?
- Yes.
See who is the man in your family.
Some people see the glass
half empty.
I see it half full.
I reached the bottom
top, ladies.
But we're not just an empire.
We are a family.
Everyone has cake?
Cake, cupcake cupcake ?
Yes, good?
We have captured many ogres.
One escaped. Who cares?
No big deal.
I do not care.
Not the end the world.
Just because... Come to think...
Shrek the ogre who's escaped!
If he receives a kiss from Fiona
before the sunrise, it is the end of the world!
Of our world!
My empire!
As I said
I like to see the glass
half full.
I encourage both.
Anybody wants some water?
Do you?
A clear and delicious glass of water?
are you thirsty?
Well, someone tells me what is needed 
to catch the Ogre ?
You!
Pointy hats?
You!
Maybe we can hire 
professional hunters.
Actually not a bad idea.
Margo!
I need a professional hunter.
And if music tame the beast,
I think I know the right person.
Listen!
We have news from the land
Far Far Away
Stiltskin lead staff
hunting ogres personally.
Shrek, that's our fault.
If that leaves claim
safety nest of sorcerers
will be vulnerable.
The plan is simple.
If run on normal route
the Patrol will
reach the river at midnight.
We will be on the road
expect the caravan.
When you get in free,
I give the signal
and then attack.
And when the smoke clears...
- Wait, what is it?
- It is my stall.
No cookies, we do not need it.
Fiona, we will be very
hungry after that.
Stop-and speech.
All right.
As I say,
when the smoke clears, Rumpelstiltskin
disappeared and the food is eaten
Far Far Away
will finally be free.
- And we.
- We moved when Rump leaves the palace.
Man, this is something serious.
Tell me. How am I to get her to
kiss me before sunrise?
I'm talking about revolution.
Revolution?
Why not tell her what you said to me?
You're her true love
and coming from an alternate universe.
And by the way, why not tell
you're married to a dragon
and you have litlle mutant donkey-dragon babies.
- I do?
- You see what has happened.
I just gonna think I am crazy.
- I'm a daddy?
- You know what?
If I had Fiona to
kiss me once,
then I can do it again.
Shrek...
Hello!
Fiona?
There should not be here, sir.
Puss?
You've got to be kidding me ..
- Feed me if you dare.
- Puss, what happened to you?
You become so gr...
- Do I know you?
- Where are your hat and belt?
- And your boots?
- Boots? For a cat?
But you're Puss in Boots.
Maybe once, but that's a
names that I do not want to go
I am wearing something else.
I may had made myself bigger in the middle
since retirement.
To give up the sword was the
best decision of my life.
I have everything I want and
I want to eat as many mice.
Catch you later.
Oh Puss, what have they done to you
You gone soft.
I do get brushed, twice a day.
Look it is not too late
Listen, all you have to do
is to help me to kiss Fiona.
- What are you doing?
- Hey.
Can I help you?
Well I know how stressful
a rebellion can be.
Assembly troops
planning attacks, so
I bring a little something
to ease the tension.
- A gifts basket?
- You're welcome. So...
see what's in it.
Heart Shaped Box with maggots...
skunk scented candles...
Now there's even some ..
Coupons. Free massage
for a leg
And mud mask!
And this one!
Good for one free kiss.
Collect it now.
Look I do not know what it is,
, but try to lead a revolution.
So if you do not have Rumpelstiltskin's head
there
I suggest you get your gift basket
and leave my tent
and go and make yourself useful.
Super.
I am sorry.
Just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?
A hug?
And a quick kiss good night.
Ouch!... Hey!
Wait. Is that mistletoe?
Shrek, are you trying to be cute? 
You make people feel uncomfortable.
- Where I found this guy?
- Is it true?
After all these years I have softened.
Do not be silly.
Now who's a beautiful cat?
I am.
Daddy makes you beautiful, Fifi.
Piglet well, leave.
Remember to take...
These little pigs wants
to go home.
Mr. Stiltskin, he is here.
Nice.
Pied Piper, how's the transport?
You call this guy

What's he gonna do?
Snooze those ogres with lullaby ? hah ..
Okay, got it!.
Make it stop.
Enough.
Looks like it's time
to pay the piper.
Seriously, it's time
to pay the piper.
Now go and bring me the
checkbook.
Go! Move! Out!
Make sure they eat.
You can not intimidate
with an empty stomach. Go now!
- Once again, please.
- Okay.
This is the last time.
Look at him!
I see.
Great friend anymore.
Now I see why you have not eaten him.
Donkey, I hate to bring the subject
But a rub on the Fiona.
We need your help.
Attention, who wants dessert?
- Where did this?
- Garbage Fone,
Just another gift from a suitor
Fiona knows everyone knows
that things will go with it.
With me going.
Donkey, what do I do? It's like
and as I do not know her.
You are trouble, mate. Also what
Fiona thinks is due.
- To issue.
- "For cause".
Hello.
- Good move.
- What are you doing?
What do you think?
I am preparing for the ambush.
I always love
to do some lifting
before action.
- This is taken?
- Use that to clean toilets.
And that just to clean stuff
which clean toilets.
I knew that.
That's boss.
Hey, Scott?
Actually my name is Shrek.
You will die in ambush
tonight.
I will be fine.
I think I can handle with...
Okay, let's see it.
What d...

A Yeah.

Dragon goes under the bridge
and finally...

All right.
All right.
It seems that you can handle.

- That's an order.
Okay, let's sharpen
those axes.
One moment!
One moment!
U... moment.
- We give a minute.
- Look Puss are less pressed for time.
I do not believe it
what I witnessed.
There you and Fiona, was a
spark, a spark in her heart.
I thought it was extinct,
but for a moment Fiona
and found true love.
I am her true love.
I ended the curse them.
Curse you know?
Day in a way other night.
This will be your bitterness
until you find kiss
true love.
And finally take
true form of love.
You know, it's true that you are.
- I have to prove it.
- How?
Convince one, go to it
when it alone and tell
something that only real
Her love would know.
What cat?
Shrek can have a keep?
Excuse me.
Make room.
Excuse me, guys.
Look, Donkey, food!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come, come Donkey!
You're a disaster!
And you are ridiculous.
I will go before.
Wait for my signal.
Ensure position.
- What view from up here.
- What are you doing?
Go back to your position.
You need to know once
Who are forever!
- You'll ruin everything.
- I will not ruin anything, in fact I will fix everything.
Ogre, your curse.
- How do you know of my curse?
- Okay.
Please, Fiona, just listen.
Can explain everything.
- Where is Fiona? Should give the signal.
- What are you waiting for?
We will escape.
There will not slip.
Listen, I do not know who you are and
know where my curse
but if any one of
learn that this Ogre ...
- A beautiful princess?
- No it is no longer that.
- Look I know you're upset.
- You know nothing about me.
I know all about you.
You play so beautifully that
soaring birds.
Big deal.
I know when
write your name put on a heart i.
- What?
- I know that when you see a shooting star
your fingers crossed
from both hands,
shields nose and put your desire.
I know you do not like blankets
around the legs
and know that you sleep with a candle,
because whenever
you close your eyes
you afraid that you'll find
that tower again.
But most importantly, Fiona
I know why
you transform
the man every day
it is because you did
never been kissed.
Well...
by me.
Move quickly.
I'm not moving.
- Why is it happening?
- Love?
- No, I am, forced to dance.
- For the Love?
No, I can not stop!
I can not... control.
Oh, yes...
No, is the flutist.
I can not believe I left
to spend it.
- Only because of you.
- Let me just kiss you.
Not say that!
We must do something before
like dancing in nothingness.
What can we do?
First you have
to a stop in this dance.
Then, it's me.
We must move away from music.
Puss and Donkey Fri
you save.
- Donkey, you may borrow the language?
- How?
No, not at all.
I do not care how big
your eyes are not I change my mind.
- Okay.
- Stop, where are you going?
To save my friends.
- How, by killing you?
- If you need...
- Puss, say something!
- Puss?
- Let me explain.
- So that you know so much about me.
Fiona, wait!
- Kiss me!
- What?
- Just so you can save your friends.
- Get out of my way.
Before you think a simple kiss
can save everything.
I do not understand.
Does not make sense!
A kiss of love should be
to fix it!
Yes, they told me and her.
True love is not me out
of that tower. I did.
I was rescued.
Do not understand?
- Are just fairy tales!
- Fiona, do not say that.
- Right there!
- And how do you know?
You have a somewhat increased
dragon cage?
You stayed alone in a
Tower miserable?
You fell asleep crying every night
waiting for true love
Why did never occurred?
But I'm Your true love.
Then where are you located
when I needed you?
Can not you kiss it good?
Kiss never worked...
that Fiona does not love me.
Do not despair ogre brothers.
We can put in cages
but we can close the honor.
Shrek and Fiona are together?
I'm sick of your crap.
I am tired of you.
Lupu, my speech,
BÃ£rbierule I need makeup.
and Flautistule,
up my socks.
Closely!
Attention citizens!
Stay in position for a post
tiranicului's our dictator.
Hi, folks.
I am... Rumpelstiltskin,
shepherd dreaming.
Recently someone put us
Our beautiful life-threatening.
And that someone is jerk
ogreish
named Shrek.
Since I came
before your citizens
that whoever brings me
this ogre
receive a lifetime supply.
Think you'll be completely happy
all your desires
most ardent.
Wildest dreams, everything...
anything you ever dreamed.
Those dreams, but hurry up,
is a limited time offer.
So ignite torches,
sharpen your pitchforks,
and catch it.
It appears that we are safe.
Yes, it appears that you are here.
Come on.
What's the point?
Kiss not funcÃ¾iont.
It is over!
I know things may seem
pretty grim now,
but things will work out eventually.
You'll see.
- This time tomorrow...
- Do not you understand?
There is no tomorrow.
There is no future days, and there is no
Next day after day.
My life was perfect
I will not ever recover!
If your life was so perfect
why did you sign the contract?
Because I knew what I had
until she went. Okay?
I did not know.
Surrender now!
Reward is mine, Ogar?
- Gingy, what are you doing?
- Let me go, green devil!
I get my reward.
- Reward?
- What are you talking, spÃ£rgÃ£torule?
Rumpelstiltskin promised
"A life business for at what you catch.
"The business of life?
And all the wishes
come true.
Hold still can fix it!
- And how are you going to do this?
- You know, I give him Rumpelstiltskin
exactly what he wants.
Gingy well, tell me about this...
O you what you eat?
Sherk is not far!
Not even an ogre, is a Pedestrian.
Nice try!
And only that.
- And what should it mean?
- I'm just a scared old man.
Do not listen!
It's an ogre.
It's your father painted green.
No, it's Shrek, honest!
Besides, take it!
I can not make him one Shrek?
Where is it?
How hard can?
I want him now?
Rumpelstiltskin, I heard that I seek.
OK! Finally.
If I brought him?
Who receives offer a lifetime?
- Me!
- What? But...
Teach me how I myself,
I receive a lifetime supply.
That means you have
give me any wish.
No, no, no, just a love kiss
can truly unwind the contract.
You thought that you stop here
and you will regain your life back?
I am not here
to regain my life.
Then what do you want?
Ogars, are all free. "
But where is Shrek?
That's not good.
Not sure, not like the end
a story.
Shrek Noble surrendered to
save a bunch of dirty Ogre .
All that matters is that they are free
and Fiona is safe.
I think Fiona would be very stirred
to hear that.
But hey, I think
you can tell him yourself.
Fiona!
Rumpelstiltskin I had a settlement?
You agreed to release all
Ogars!
Yes, but there's an ogre Fiona,
eh?
Day in a way
another night.
Nobody is smarter than me.
You have done a
very brave Shrek.
Thank you.
You were right, I was not
there for you.
And not just the Dragon Castle,
but every day since then.
Well, you're here now.
Let me go,
must save him Shrek.
Do not be silly.
He's right. Safety here
is very strict.
And in addition, there is a clique
miserable witch.
Hey, you can hear
Sorry!
- You gotta go there.
- Shrek showed me how to get out of there.
But how?
Just as there will burst.
My new world.
Looks better in the catalog.
Witch finally time
that you all expected.
The main event series.
You portray Shrek and Fiona.
And now, to leave
back past the final...
old princess nightmare,
cage keeper, Dragon.
Just shout,
and I'll be there...
Donkey and Puss!
Boots!
Get them, witch!
- Ass, gives her a part.
- Who?
Your wife?
Hi, I am looking on.
can see in your eyes.
'll Call me.
We love.
Fiona, keep on!
Now!
Dragon, in attic
and finally, in the castle.
Farewell!
Victory is ours!
It seems strange that it got
breakfast curly.
Hey, we are a team of grandmothers.
You never know.
Shrek?
So he ended the day!
- Shrek?
- Okay.
May need to do something.
You have already done everything for me, Fiona.
- Give me a house and a family.
- Do you have children?
We have kids.
- Fergus, Farco, and daughter named...

I always wanted to have a
daughter named Felicia.
And one fine day...
Coming.
You know which was best
part of the day today?
It was fortunate that I
I love you again.
Fiona, the sun rises.
And are still a Ogre .
- True love kiss.

Kiss worked.
